# About

<div class="blurb">
	<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Group in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley working with Mark van der Laan. I completed my PhD in biostatistics at Harvard University with Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen. Broadly, I am interested in developing semiparametric methodology for causal inference with applications in areas seeking to bring relief to populations suffering from poverty and disease, especially public health. My methodological research is largely in interference, measurement error, and mediation analysis; my applied focus is in HIV/AIDS and preterm birth.</p>
